# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on predicting cardiovascular diseases using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset from the Framingham Heart Study and employs various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases in individuals.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **Models**: Saved models and their performance metrics.
- **Results**: Visualizations and performance metrics of different models.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results and insights

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ishitabhadra/Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction.git
    cd Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the notebooks**:
    Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory to explore the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

To train and evaluate the models, you can run the notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory. Each notebook is self-contained and includes detailed explanations and code comments.
